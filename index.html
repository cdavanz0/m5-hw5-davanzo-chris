			<p> Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Christopher. This page was created as part of my course learning to how to write HTML mark-up and understand web design. I am a grad student at the University of Florida studying Political Communications. More generally, I am a 25-year-old trying to learn more in the aim of advancing my career in the media and communications industries. On this page, you will hopefully learn more about me and my work history, from independent projects to my career thus far and anything else in between.</p>

			<h2>About</h2>
				<p>I graduated from high school in 2015 and then studied at Florida State University until 2018, receiving a bachelor's degree in English and Political Science. My main area of study was creative writing. Even though my sentence strucutre is weak here, undermining my skills, I spent the last several years learning the elements of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. My time at FSU cemented the passion I have for storytelling and problem solving creatively, but witnessing each of the other talented writers only heighetend my anxiety. After graduating, I temporarirly relocated and became a team reporter for a college baseball team. I had this job for about three months until the season was over. Shortly thereafter, I worked as intern for a film festival and did social media for a small film and commerical production company. In 2019, I was the Marketing Coordinator for a local credit union and since 2020, I have been the Communication Specialist for my town's local Community Foundation and Nonprofit Resource Center.  </p>
